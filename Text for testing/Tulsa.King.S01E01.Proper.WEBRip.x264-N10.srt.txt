1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,040
<i>MTV ♪</i>

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,580
This is USP Canaan.

3
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:18,015
The federal prison in
Northern Pennsylvania.

4
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:21,392
Definitely not a great choice
for a destination wedding.

5
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:29,432
I subsisted in hellholes like
this for the last 25 years,

6
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:33,003
and to keep what's left of
my brain from deteriorating,

7
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:37,214
I read some very good literature
and wrote some very bad poems

8
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:41,478
and tried to avoid getting
shanked for a second time.

9
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:47,318
I remember when I was
17, my father asked

10
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:49,048
what I wanted to be.

11
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:52,153
If I'd like to be
a barber like him.

12
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:54,691
I laughed in his face.

13
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:57,662
I wanted to be a
successful gangster.

14
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,761
In retrospect, I ask myself

15
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,904
if what I chose
for an occupation

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,170
was worth 25 years of my life.

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,600
The answer is no.

18
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,366
Not 25 seconds.

19
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:13,539
But those are bygone times,

20
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:16,144
water under the bridge.

21
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:17,814
I married this life,

22
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:21,215
and after keeping my mouth
shut for all these years,

23
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:24,919
I'm gonna see if
it married me back.

24
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:12,828
- What about Scores?
- What?

25
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,196
There's a party, right?

26
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:17,443
Long Island.

27
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,241
What?

28
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,411
Long Island.

29
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,214
Why?

30
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,246
They gave me an address.

31
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,869
Whose house is this?

32
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,074
They didn't say.

33
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,230
Supposed to wait here.

34
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:31,336
They're ready for you.

35
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,992
Gang's all here.

36
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,694
There he is.

37
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,227
Nice place you got here.

38
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,428
How you doin', Chickie?

39
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,097
Uncle Dwight.

40
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,244
- Remember Vince?
- I do.

41
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,976
- Have a seat.
- At the head of the table?

42
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,909
That ain't the head,
that's the ass.

43
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,254
Witty.

44
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:16,121
Nico, Mario, you guys
gotta stand behind me?

45
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,827
We're watching the
door, buddy, that's all.

46
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,551
Well, you can
watch from anywhere

47
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,631
- like that corner over there.
- What can they do,

48
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,935
someone comes
through the doorway

49
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,830
the fuck over there, Dwight?

50
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,258
You expecting company, Glenny?

51
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:28,855
What's wrong with you?

52
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,426
Nothing, I just don't like
guys standing behind me.

53
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,205
Easy, buddy, we're
just watching the door.

54
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,673
Don't stand behind
my fuckin' back.

55
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,642
- Just give him some space.
- Where I've been,

56
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,310
- it's not a good idea.
- <i>Ashpet,</i> relax.

57
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,441
- Sit down...
- Not exactly

58
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,576
the welcome I was expecting.

59
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,482
Business first.

60
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:48,424
How is business?

61
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,493
It's tough.

62
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:59,157
Am I supposed to be
talking to him or to you?

63
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,132
Chickie's my underboss now.

64
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,572
Vince is one of my capos.

65
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:07,944
Lot of changes.

66
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,436
Twenty-five years.

67
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:10,837
I was a kid when you went away.

68
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,871
I got news for you,
you're still a kid,

69
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,706
so enjoy it.

70
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:18,112
Like I was saying,
things are tough.

71
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,745
Not like when you were around.

72
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,580
No, it was easy
when I was around.

73
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,545
- Just a little bit.
- Listen to my son.

74
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,684
Look-look-look, I don't
know what you're expecting,

75
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,489
okay, now that you're back,

76
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,721
but we can't just
rewind the clock.

77
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,557
I'll tell you what
I'm expecting,

78
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,732
that way you'll know.
I'm expecting after doing

79
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:36,701
25 years, to save
your father's ass,

80
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,830
for a murder, to save your ass,

81
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,096
whacking a guy, who
I actually liked,

82
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,704
who didn't deserve it,

83
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,836
I'm expecting some form
of adequate compensation.

84
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,583
What do you think, we're
not gonna take care of you?

85
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,109
Are you?

86
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,083
Yes.

87
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,682
Tulsa.

88
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:03,818
- What the fuck is Tulsa?
- It's a city in Oklahoma.

89
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,877
I know it's a city in
Oklahoma, I can read a map.

90
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,496
What the fuck are
you talking about?

91
00:07:07,497 --> 00:07:08,725
I want you to go there.

92
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,732
Plant a flag, get it set up.

93
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,374
- Are you serious?
- Oh, yeah.

94
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:15,341
Dwight, I've been
there, the horse races,

95
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:17,743
Springboard Mile, it's
wide fuckin' open.

96
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:20,241
It's the future. There's
nobody doing nothing.

97
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,813
You can earn like crazy. Do
whatever the fuck you want.

98
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,653
But I'd be doing it in Oklahoma.

99
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,808
There's nothing
left for you here.

100
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:31,176
I'm sorry. But time
just doesn't stop

101
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,048
because you fuckin' went away.

102
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,855
Nothing left for me here.

103
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,776
Hey.

104
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:00,711
You remember my wife Marie?

105
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,015
She divorced me
when I went aside,

106
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,651
and my daughter Tina?

107
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,856
I haven't talked
to her in 18 years.

108
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,288
She hates me.

109
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,887
I took an oath.
And I honored it.

110
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:17,126
I kept my mouth shut
for 25 fuckin' years.

111
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:20,634
And now all I got to
my name is a few bucks,

112
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:22,898
my suit in mothballs,
this watch,

113
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,866
and a fuckin' pinky
ring that you gave me.

114
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,910
Now, you got the
balls to tell me that,

115
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,583
after everything
I've been through,

116
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,652
after everything I've
lost, after everything

117
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,581
I've done for this
family... Your family...

118
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,616
Fuck... there's
nothing left for me?!

119
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,651
Hey! You don't understand
how this fuckin' works.

120
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,688
They told you where
the fuck to go.

121
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,363
- That's it.
- I don't understand?

122
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,831
Listen, I made my bones

123
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,459
when you were in
fuckin' diapers.

124
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:49,255
Well, now you're
wearing diapers.

125
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,996
Back the fuck up!

126
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,602
Are you outta your
fuckin' mind?!

127
00:08:53,603 --> 00:08:55,141
No, I'm not outta my mind.

128
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,338
- This guy has no respect.
- He's a capo, Dwight.

129
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,441
To you, Pete, not to me!

130
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,781
This wasn't our deal.

131
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:08,317
Jesus Christ, I came here
with some sense of honor.

132
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:10,348
You talk about compensation?

133
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:14,723
I'm giving you a whole
entire fuckin' city!

134
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:18,225
You're giving me
fuckin' banishment.

135
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,988
You kick up five
grand a week to start.

136
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,658
Sure, why not?

137
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:32,207
Tulsa. Yeah, why not?

138
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,209
Be nice to breathe
some fresh air.

It's a grasshopper.
They're harmless.

149

That thing's the
size of my cock.

150
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:34,268
- Excuse me?
- Actually, I'm more endowed than that,

Relax, it's holy
water, it's holy water.

153
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,868
You should gargle with
it with that mouth.

154
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,853
These Church of God folks
bless the shit out of you,

155
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,007
you're not careful.

156
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,645
- Need a cab?
- Actually, I do.

157
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,580
Let me get you right here then.

158
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:50,576
Name's Tyson, welcome to Tulsa.

159
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:53,048
- Where to, man?
- Hotel.

160
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,346
Which one?

161
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,157
One where no one
will break my balls.

162
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,343
Why do they call this
place the Sooner State?

163
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,272
Well, you got the football team.

164
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,037
- Mm-hmm.
- That's all Sooner history.

165
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,016
You know, when people
first came here and shit.

166
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,905
- Settlers.
- When was that?

167
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:22,848
Back in the day, I
guess, I don't know.

168
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,321
You're not curious?

169
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,163
Not really.

170
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,762
You know what'd be nice?

171
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,428
If someone invented a device

172
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,959
where you could
look this shit up,

173
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:35,904
that would really be great.

174
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,659
You trippin', man?

175
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,898
The iPhone, man, you...

176
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,373
Oh, you fuckin'
with me, man, you...

177
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,214
I can't look it up right now.

178
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,809
I'm... I'm driving right now.

179
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,211
Yeah, all right, forget it.

180
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:55,521
Lot of churches around here.

181
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,378
It's the Bible Belt, my man.

182
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,387
And you in the buckle.

183
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,419
So is this a
wedding? A funeral?

184
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,085
- Business.
- What kind of business?

185
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,785
The "none of your
fuckin' business"

186
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,527
kind of business.

187
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,871
I like that. Gangster
gotta be a gangster, huh?

188
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,329
What'd you call me?

189
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,196
- Say what?
- You called me a gangster.

190
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,805
I didn't call you no gangster,
I said a gangster gotta...

191
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:21,706
- be a gangster.
- Wouldn't that make me a gangster?

192
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,787
Look, man, you obviously ain't
met no Black folks, or...

193
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,811
I met more Black folks
than you can count.

194
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:27,523
Well, then you would
know, you can call anybody

195
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,677
a gangster, it's like
saying they cool.

196
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,617
You think a gangster is cool?

197
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:37,361
Aight, it's like... it's
like calling a dude a player.

198
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,590
Except I say gangster, I
ain't sayin' you in a gang.

199
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:43,257
You know, you my gangster like
a motherfucker right now...

200
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,026
You'd better stop
calling me that, pal.

201
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,542
Hey, look, ain't nobody
gonna tell me what to say

202
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,236
in my own cab, you
got that... gangster?

203
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,146
You know what, someone's
gonna slap some good grammar

204
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,680
in your mouth, and
that's gonna be me...

205
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,249
Hey, ain't nobody gonna
talk to me like that

206
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,743
- in my own damn cab...
- Hey, hey!

207
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,652
You want some gangster?
I'll give you gangster.

208
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,546
Stop the car.

209
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,481
What is that place?

210
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,875
It's a dispensary.

211
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,447
It's where they sell marijuana.

212
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,545
So anybody can
just walk in there?

213
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,157
Yeah, it's a store,
man, what you want?

214
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,130
- Uh-huh, who runs it?
- Whoever owns it.

215
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,300
Nah, I mean, who runs
this neighborhood?

216
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,098
Like, what crew runs it?

217
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,870
Ain't no crew up in here, man.

218
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,529
You're in the middle of nowhere.

219
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,537
No, I got that. Why don't
you pull over there?

220
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,210
Well, wait a little
bit until I come out.

221
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,639
This will compensate
you for your time.

222
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,237
Excuse me, sir. Let me
see your medical ID.

223
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,569
It's okay, I'm just
looking around.

224
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,405
It's okay.

225
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,700
- I'm not gonna buy anything.
- Yeah, that's cool, man.

226
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,539
Thanks, appreciate it.

227
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,917
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

228
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,516
Can I help you?

229
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,750
Yeah, uh, I just got into town.

230
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,520
And I'm just looking around.

231
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,725
And I'm wondering, how
does all this work?

232
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:21,686
Oh, um... depends on
what you're looking for.

233
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:23,958
- Mm.
- Um, we got gummies...

234
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,197
- Mm-hmm.
- Actual flower,

235
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,273
CBD oil, creams,

236
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:32,542
uh, strictly for
medicinal purposes.

237
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,552
If you're just looking
to get high, let me know.

238
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:37,944
- Take credit cards?
- It's cash only, sorry.

239
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:40,575
Really? Oh.

240
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,283
You only have one
guard and no cameras.

241
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,986
Where I come from, very risky.

242
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,989
We don't get much crime here.

243
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,691
Oh, that's good.

244
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,958
So, who owns this shithole?

245
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:55,501
Uh, excuse me?

246
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,100
I said...

247
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,672
who owns this shithole?

248
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:05,135
- Uh, Bodhi.
- Where's Bodhi?

249
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:06,572
In his office?

250
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,776
Are you asking me or telling me?

251
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,084
Go get Bodhi.

252
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,983
I... I can't leave
the desk, man.

253
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,552
Hey...

254
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,257
put down the pork
rinds and get Bodhi.

255
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,190
- What?
- You heard me, Jumbo.

256
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,426
Get Bodhi.

257
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,003
Listen, asshole, take a hike.

258
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,337
Come on, man, time to go.

259
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,006
You got a tire iron?

260
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:47,012
Yeah, yeah, I can go
to the back and...

261
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:48,417
Forget it.

262
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,548
- Hey, yo, that's my juice.
- Ssh.

263
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,024
Anybody got the time?

264
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,023
All right, listen,
mister, I told you to...

265
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,822
- Aah!
- Oh, my God!

266
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,925
Okay, what the fuck, Clint.

267
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,500
You must be Bodhi.

268
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,900
Yeah, who the... who are you?

269
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:08,173
- What's your name again?
- Clint.

270
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,471
Clint. Stand next to Clint.

271
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,838
Is this a robbery? Fuck.

272
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:16,878
Fred?

273
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:18,654
Oh, my God, is he dead?

274
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,448
Nah, he's taking a break.

275
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,920
Excuse me, sweetheart.

276
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,550
Are you waiting for an
engraved invitation?

277
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:28,555
I'm way too fucking
high for this, can...

278
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,118
Can I just wait it
out over here, please?

279
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:33,888
Put your phone on the
counter and take a seat.

280
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,934
I need to see your books.

281
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:38,404
My books?

282
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,201
Your books, your ledgers, files,

283
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,603
whatever you got.

284
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,474
Are you... from
the government?

285
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,974
I just knocked your
guard out, cold,

286
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,107
and you think I'm a CPA?

287
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,112
So, you're not with
the government.

288
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,405
Let's take a walk.

289
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,692
Look at these numbers.
You're making a fortune.

290
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,618
So, where are you
keeping this money?

291
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,787
It's in the bank.

292
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,525
I swear, it's in the bank.

293
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,903
Only states
legalized this stuff.

294
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,570
You put that money in the bank,

295
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,142
and the Feds will
have it by morning.

296
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,410
Even you're smart
enough to know that.

297
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,639
I'm not lying to you.

298
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,914
Let me paint you a picture.

299
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,111
You see my shoe?

300
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,376
Yeah.

301
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,024
Now, I'm gonna take the heel

302
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,349
of my right shoe,
which is very sharp,

303
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:32,754
and stomp it...

304
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,015
Very hard

305
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,115
on the top of your left foot,

306
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:40,034
breaking at least three
or four metatarsals.

307
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:43,858
It's excruciating.
I don't wanna do it.

308
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,626
So, let me ask you again.

309
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,970
Could it be in the desk?
Could it be in the microwave?

310
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:55,478
Or could the safe
be behind that...

311
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,678
silly poster?

312
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,018
You don't need to put
yourself through this.

313
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:11,315
I wanna be your friend, I
want you to be my friend.

314
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,028
I don't wanna hurt your feet.

315
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,330
Just open the safe, please.

316
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,401
My God.

317
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,173
How much you got there?

318
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:23,899
Half a million.

319
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,966
This is how it's gonna work.

320
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:28,413
I'm gonna take 20% a week.

321
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:32,746
Hey, we all got bosses,
even I answer to somebody.

322
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:36,179
But in exchange, I'll
protect you from the gangs.

323
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,616
What gangs?

324
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,190
- And the law.
- This is legal.

325
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,387
And if you attacked by
locusts, I'll spray 'em.

326
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:46,732
Please, don't make me have
to be an asshole about this.

327
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,999
Okay? I protect you.

328
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:50,526
And you pay me a commission.

329
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,873
Capisce?

330
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,407
That's really all
you're gonna take?

331
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05,042
What did I just
say? We're partners.

332
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:08,852
You make the money, and
I make sure you keep it.

333
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,319
Do we have a deal?

334
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:14,451
- Do I have a choice?
- Absolutely not.

335
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,856
What happened to my bottle?

336
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,434
- I was thirsty.
- You don't want it.

337
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,426
It's got blood all
over it. Open the door.

338
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,543
When you're not driving a cab,
what kind of car do you drive?

339
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,639
Pssh, the repo man took it.

340
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,441
Here's some money.

341
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,937
I want you to buy me this car.

342
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,012
- A Navigator?
- Yep, new one, black,

343
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:44,418
and you drive for me now.

344
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,051
What?

345
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,394
Two grand a week.

346
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:54,258
My gangster.

347
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,731
Let's go to the hotel.

348
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,133
Stop with that gangster shit.

349
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,218
Okay, Tyson, I need you here

350
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,650
tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM.

351
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:22,356
Wear a collared shirt, 00 AM.

352
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:33,758
Can I help you, Mister...

353
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,361
Manfredi.

354
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:37,002
Can you call me a cab?

355
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,799
Oh, we don't really get

356
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:40,571
a lot of cabs around here,

357
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,070
- but you can call an Uber.
- Oh, yeah, what's the number?

358
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:45,172
There's no number,
you just use the app

359
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:48,142
- on your phone.
- Oh.

360
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:50,653
Do you have an
app on your phone?

361
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:52,207
Of course.

362
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:55,683
Ms. McNamara, call me an Uber.

00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:40,325

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,130

Well, I assume you
don't have chianti.

373
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:49,644
You assume correctly.

374
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:52,039
- Okay.
- What you need's a bourbon.

375
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:53,841
Yeah, and why is that?

376
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,143
Well, because I was really
hoping you'd buy me one.

377
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,290
You'll have to forgive
my friend here,

378
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:01,476
mister, he's a goddamn mooch.

379
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:04,954
Hey, the answer is
always no until you ask.

380
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,594
I'll have a bourbon for
me and my two pals here.

381
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,520
- See?
- Bourbon it is.

382
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:13,591
Is it all right to eat here?

383
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,727
Best seat in the house.

384
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:18,203
And what do you suggest?

385
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,070
You find better ribs in Tulsa...

386
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,769
You let me know.

387
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,901
Ah, then ribs it is.

388
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,480
So, where's home, friend?

389
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,579
I'm gonna give you two guesses,

390
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,781
but I bet you'll get it in one.

391
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:38,254

- You're good, very good.

392
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:40,254
I couldn't help
notice, are those

393
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:41,946
lizard boots you're wearing?

394
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,558
Yes, sir, they are.

395
00:23:44,691 --> 00:23:46,961
Made in Texas just like me.

396
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,163
Check these out.

397
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:52,096
Made in Italy, like my old man.

398
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:55,771
Well, how about that?
We both like dinosaurs.

399
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:57,572
There you go.

I'm no expert, but
I'm pretty sure

406
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,532
that's not a Lincoln Navigator.

407
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:23,158
It's my mom's.

408
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,725
And?

409
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:27,134
Had to go home and get it
after the car dealership.

410
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:30,566
- Where's the Navigator?
- He wouldn't sell me one.

411
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,873
- You show him the cash?
- What happened was

412
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:35,635
he called me a crack dealer,
threatened to call the police.

413
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,824
Take me there.

414
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,742
Good morning. How
can I help you?

415
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:11,837
No one's gonna know, what
are you worried about?

416
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,350
Uh-huh.

417
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:18,791
Listen, uh, let
me call you back.

418
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:22,686
Donnie Shore. What
can I do you for?

419
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,692
Perry Cuomo, nice to meet you.

420
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:27,694
It seems we have a
slight misunderstanding.

421
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:29,897
See, my associate
was in earlier,

422
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:33,429
trying to buy that Navigator
that you got downstairs,

423
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,370
but you wouldn't sell it to him.

424
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:37,501
Oh, boy, I am so sorry.

425
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:39,137
Why, Donnie?

426
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,611
Well, you know, it was a
total misunderstanding.

427
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,408
Like you said yourself.

428
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,810
The truth is, he's a good kid.

429
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:48,745
Probably never had a day
of trouble in his life.

430
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,881
You see the problem is,
you see a young Black guy

431
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:53,948
with a mountain of money...
Right away, you say,

432
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,686
hey, he's gotta
be a drug dealer.

433
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:57,622
- Oh.
- But I walk in,

434
00:25:57,624 --> 00:25:59,494
in a nice suit...

435
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:01,786
and you're not afraid anymore.

436
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:04,098
You see, the irony is...

437
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:06,927
he's afraid of the wrong thing.

438
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:11,667
- I'm not following.
- Well, follow this.

439
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,640
Aah... I'm calling the police.

440
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:17,775
Hey, let me get
the phone for ya.

441
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:21,782
Here's the deal, Donnie.

442
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,224
You're gonna sell
my friend over here

443
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,790
the black Navigator

444
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,388
for $50,000 cash.

445
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,790
- Loaded.
- Loaded.

446
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:34,664
- Deal?
- Okay.

447
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,658
This wasn't necessary.

448
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:50,505
This is crazy.

449
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:52,807
I forgot how good ice cream is.

450
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,875
They didn't give you
ice cream in jail?

451
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,584
No.

452
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:59,686
Usually it was tiramisu.

453
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:02,353
That's a joke, right?

454
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:08,062
Eh...

455
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:09,604
Enough.

456
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:12,399
I'm gonna go wash up, I'll
meet you back at the car,

457
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:14,771
we're gonna go see Bodhi.

458
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:37,791
Hey.

459
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,592
How you doin', Fred?

460
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:44,058
- I've been better.
- Try the Advil.

461
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,726
Thanks.

462
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,869
What's with this puss?

463
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,071
That's how you
welcome customers?

464
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,143
Are you a customer now?

465
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,906
You know, you're in
the service business.

466
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:58,983
You gotta be welcoming.

467
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:04,217
- This is Tyson, by the way.
- What's up?

468
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:06,654
I got something for you.

469
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:08,586
Security camera.

470
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,862
And before you
say anything, yes,

471
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:14,091
I get the irony.

472
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:20,865
So, how much did we make today?

473
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,769
Um, <i>we</i> made

474
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,140
a little over five grand so far.

475
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:29,012
You're a sarcastic
little prick, aren't you?

476
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:33,246
So, tell me, where do
you get your weed from?

477
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,249
There's a greenhouse
and a 40-acre farm

478
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:37,051
a couple hours north of here.

479
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:39,793
That's where I buy.
They're licensed.

480
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,246
- Who are "they"?
- A guy named Jimmy.

481
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,788
Is he a front for somebody?
'Cause a lot of these farms

482
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:47,834
are fronts for cartels,
you gotta know your risks.

483
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,600
There was no risk
until you came along.

484
00:28:50,797 --> 00:28:52,827
You know, the Feds can
waltz in here right now,

485
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:56,165
take every dollar you got, and
there's not a goddamn thing

486
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:58,272
you can do about it.

487
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:01,314
- What do you suggest I do?
- Clean it.

488
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,910
You mean, uh, launder it?

489
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:07,213
I mean like George
fuckin' Jefferson.

490
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,484
The TV show, before your time?

491
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,886
Had a lot of dry
cleaners. Not important.

492
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:15,549
What's important is you
get that money outta here

493
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,557
- as fast as you can.
- Okay, isn't that illegal?

494
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,230
You sell pot for Christ's sake.

495
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:25,601
And... where should I put it?

496
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:28,331
Tanning salons. Used
to be big business.

497
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,097
Now they're big losers.

498
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:33,836
- Clubs, discos.
- A disco?

499
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,310
Whatever you call 'em nowadays.

500
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,141
I just don't wanna
get in trouble.

501
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,307
There's more than one
kind of trouble, Bodhi,

502
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:43,576
Especially when you have
money like that in the safe.

503
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,445
Now, you listen to
what I'm saying.

504
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:50,856
If you need me, I'll be
at the Western Plains.

505
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:53,357
The Western Plains?

506
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:58,131
- What?
- It's a dump.

507
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,402
What's the best hotel in Tulsa?

508
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,407
- The Mayo.
- So why am I not staying there?

509
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,040
You said you wanted
to be in a place

510
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,519
that wasn't gonna bust
your balls, right?

511
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:14,653
So I put you in
the Western Plains.

512
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,350
You can do your gang...
your illegal business stuff.

513
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,194
Go get my stuff, I'm
gonna check into the Mayo,

514
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,120
then I need you to drop me off

515
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,255
at a place called
the Bred-2-Buck.

516
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:26,891
What in the hell is that?

517
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:28,786
Cowboy bar, what do I know?

518
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:30,328
In the future,

519
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:32,102
if anyone asks what
I do for a living,

520
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,071
you tell 'em I'm
an industrialist.

521
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,970
What does that even mean?

522
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:39,742
My point exactly.
Nobody knows.

523
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:46,781
How you holding in, Pops?

524
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:48,253
Eh, I'm doin' all right.

525
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,263
My dad.

526
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,258
Don't trust leaving
him home alone,

527
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,930
so I take him to work with
me so's I can babysit.

528
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:06,103
I'm Mitch, by the way.

529
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:07,972
Dwight.

530
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,140
A <i>paisan</i> named Dwight, huh?

531
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:12,239
Dwight David Manfredi.

532
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,311
My parents are proud immigrants

533
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,380
that named me after
the greatest general

534
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,008
of the 20th century.

535
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:19,954
Mm.

536
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,079
Let me ask you something.

537
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,624
How long were you in the joint?

538
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:29,058
I was about to ask
you the same thing.

539
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:31,258
Twenty-five years,

540
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,030
last six in Canaan, you?

541
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,960
Little over eight, Lompoc.

542
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:38,295
Excuse me?

543
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:41,496
Are you famous?

544
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:43,801
I hope not.

545
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,469
Are you sure?

546
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,644
Oh, sweetheart,
if you have to ask

547
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:50,883
if someone's famous,
they're not famous.

548
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:55,251
Oh... can we take
a picture with you?

549
00:31:56,983 --> 00:32:00,123
I don't mean this in a bad
way, but I'd rather not.

550
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,822
Well, you're no fun.

551
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:05,993
Tell me about it.

552
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:09,003
How long have you
had this joint?

553
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:10,995
A little over five years.

554
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:13,427
I was on the circuit.

555
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:16,395
- Bull riding.
- Bull riding, really?

556
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:20,335
Got busted up.
Addicted to pain pills.

557
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,812
Ran into a little trouble.

558
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,709
Then I started flying around.

559
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:27,183
Well, here's to clear skies.

560
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:28,683
Hey.

561
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:30,854
Why were you rude to my friend?

562
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:35,452
I wasn't being rude.

563
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:37,717
I just don't like
having my picture taken.

564
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:40,826
Why? Are you wanted
or something?

565
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:42,427
Nobody wants me.

566
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,631
You're not that bad.

567
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:47,833
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

568
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:50,044
Well, you messed up,

569
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:54,039
because they were gonna
invite you to the party.

570
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:58,841
- What party?
- Karaoke Castle.

571
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:01,145
Sounds exciting, but
I wouldn't really

572
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,450
call that a party.

573
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,452
What do you call a party?

574
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,494

Come dance with me.

611
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,555
Tough guys don't dance.

612
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,355
You don't take pictures,
you don't dance.

613
00:34:58,497 --> 00:35:00,067
What do you do?

614
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,769
Well, if I wasn't a gentleman,

615
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,300
I just might tell you.

616
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,965
Well, if I wasn't a lady,

617
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:06,841
maybe I'd want you to.

618
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:08,872
You're something.

619
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:11,875
You live around here?

620
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,680
Yeah, I'm out at the Mayo.

621
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:16,652
You wanna show me your minibar?

622
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,749
Haven't you had enough already?

623
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:22,619
We'd better hurry
up, before I sober up

624
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,794
and lose my nerve.

625
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:30,063
You got a car?

626
00:35:30,196 --> 00:35:31,926
No, not with me.

627
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:35,073
But we'll... figure it out.

628
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:46,309
Hey, can I wear your robe?

629
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:47,775
Yeah, go ahead.

630
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:52,316
Well.

631
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:54,251
This was very fun.

632
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:56,046
Yeah, it was great.

633
00:35:56,222 --> 00:35:58,462
Just a little rusty, you know?

634
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,390
It's been a while.

635
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:02,826
Really?

636
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:06,031
- You got a cigarette?
- Nah, I don't smoke.

637
00:36:06,232 --> 00:36:10,072
I wouldn't've pegged
you as the boy scout.

638
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:11,496
Why not?

639
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:13,807
The accent, the tattoos.

640
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:16,909
Affinity for very
classy strip clubs.

641
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:19,452
I'm new in town.

642
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:20,908
Are you married?

643
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:23,006
I was, a long time ago.

644
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:26,888
- You?
- Middle of a divorce.

645
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,288
You were actually
the deciding factor.

646
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:32,262
How's that?

647
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:35,531
Well, I figured if I could
actually go through with it,

648
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:38,061
there was no turning back.

649
00:36:38,264 --> 00:36:40,274
I'm glad to be your Rubicon.

650
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:43,099
- What's that?
- That's a river in Italy

651
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:45,339
that Julius Caesar
crossed, you know, it's...

652
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:48,511
The idiom is, it's the
point of no return.

653
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:52,036
Hm.

654
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,846
How old are you?

655
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:59,052
Seriously.

656
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:01,594
Why don't you just
say, hey, Dwight,

657
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,720
where were you when
JFK got assassinated?

658
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:08,086
All right, where
the fuck were you?

659
00:37:08,294 --> 00:37:10,664
I was a senior in high school.

660
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:14,574
Seriously?

661
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,470
That would make you, what...

662
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,540
Seventy-five big ones.

663
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,638
Oh, my God.

664
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:30,322
Are you kidding
me? I mean... I...

665
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:33,119
I would've said
you were a hard 55.

666
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:35,449
Hard's the key word
here, isn't it?

667
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,958
Oh, I'm sorry, you know what,

668
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,860
I'm gonna go.

669
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,332
Is it the age gap?

670
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:43,858
No, this is not an age gap.

671
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,625
This is an age canyon.

672
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,495
Are you hungry? I could
call room service.

673
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:51,165
No, I'm good, thank you.

674
00:37:51,337 --> 00:37:53,037
I don't even know your name.

675
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,511
You know, probably better
to keep it that way.

676
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,506
You know, normally I
would drive you home,

677
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:02,375
but I can call you an Uber,
'cause I just got an app.

678
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:05,054
I'm good... thank
you, seriously.

679
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,993
Um, really...

680
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,688
you know, I had...

681
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:11,355
I had a good time.

682
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:14,391
Maybe I'll see you around.

683
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:17,997
It was nice meeting you.

684
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,769
Bye.

685
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,211
So, this is Tulsa.

686
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:32,677
Nice enough place,

687
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,751
but for me a
prison, nonetheless.

688
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,580
That's not a complaint,
it's just a fact.

689
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:40,586
The result of a
lifetime of bad choices.

690
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:44,418
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Eddie, it's Armand.

691
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,116
<i>The Oklahoma Kid.</i>

692
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,857
Listen to me.

693
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,403
Is there any fuckin' possibility

694
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:52,556
I just saw Dwight
Manfredi in Tulsa?

695
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:54,498
I guess you could
say I was banished.

696
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:58,003
Exiled, sentenced to start
from scratch, and that's fine.

697
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:00,406
I'll do it. I'll rebuild.

698
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:03,106
You want me to earn?

699
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:04,781
I'll earn.

700
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,480
I'll earn so much money
you'll choke on it.

701
00:39:07,613 --> 00:39:09,523
And in addition to over
half a million dollars

702
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:11,648
of stolen ammo,
we're also tracking

703
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,693
a shipment of stolen AR-15s,
which more than likely will go

704
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,460
to the highest bidder among
the local militia groups.

705
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:20,289
And finally... our
friends at the FBI

706
00:39:20,426 --> 00:39:21,986
have alerted us
to a new visitor.

707
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:25,327
Not really our purview, but
a high-ranking mafia capo

708
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:26,974
who was recently
released from prison

709
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,328
has decided to grace
Tulsa with his presence.

710
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:31,198
Dwight Manfredi...

711
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:33,566
- Oh, fuck me.
- AKA Ike, or sometimes

712
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,635
Cinque Stelle, which means
"five star" in Italian.

713
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:38,535
At least two murders
to his credit,

714
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:40,317
both in the '90s, but
we are not to assume

715
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:42,176
he's some toothless tiger.

716
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,653
Abandon me? Ostracize me?

717
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:47,853
Alienate me from my
friends and family?

718
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:50,686
All the people I love?

719
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:53,492
I'll survive.

720
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:03,799
And here I am. Bloodied
but not beaten.

721
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:05,865
Down but not out.

722
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:08,274
And from this point on,

723
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,836
this city and everything in it

724
00:40:10,976 --> 00:40:13,476
belongs to me.

725
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:35,572
- You'd open the door.
- Seriously?

726
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:38,301
No, but it would've been nice.

727
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,806
I need to talk to your supplier.

728
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:43,443
You got a last name, <i>wasicu?</i>

729
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:45,835
- What does that mean?
- Non-Indian person

730
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:48,647
- who steals the fat.
- That's a first.

731
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,658
What does your family
think about you being here?

732
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:52,660
That thing with Vince. You
gotta make this go away.

733
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:54,724
Not your mob family.
Your real family.

734
00:40:54,853 --> 00:40:57,963
I haven't seen my
daughter in 18 years.

735
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:01,289
There's nothing left
for me in New York.
